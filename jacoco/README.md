# JaCoCo

Provides support for [JaCoCo](https://github.com/jacoco/jacoco) Code Coverage in combination with Java containers.
* Allows for recording of code coverage files
* Support for Testcontainers API

NOTE: Using this is a bit complex as it also requires some changes to the java application in the container.<br/>
Please have a look at the [advanced-demo](./../advanced-demo/) and the corresponding [GitHub Actions workflow](../.github/workflows/run-integration-tests.yml) for details.
