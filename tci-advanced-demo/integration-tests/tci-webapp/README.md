This module contains the [WebApp](../tci-webapp/) as TCI.

If the image for the WebApp is missing, it's dynamically built using [advanced-imagebuilder](https://github.com/xdev-software/testcontainers-advanced-imagebuilder/).
The dynamic building uses caching so if there are no changes for the actual app nothing has to be rebuilt.
