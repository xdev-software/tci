# Advanced TCI Demo

This demo is a reference implementation for TCI.

It represents a Spring Boot Application with a Database and OIDC authentication that is tested using Selenium.
There are also test that validate the database migrations and queries.

The most interesting project is probably [webapp-it](./webapp-it/) which contains the integration tests for the WebApp.

> [!TIP]
> Pre defined launchers exist for running the app and the integration tests.
