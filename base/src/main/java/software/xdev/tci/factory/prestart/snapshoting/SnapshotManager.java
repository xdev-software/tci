/**
 * A snapshot represents a container with/at a given state (basically an image or "checkpoint").
 * <p>
 * When multiple containers always require the same configuration (e.g. creating a database and migrating it) this can
 * be used to massively speed up the process.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * It works like this:
 * <ol>
 *     <li>The initial container is started and configured</li>
 *     <li>The initial container is "snapshoted"</li>
 *     <li>The snapshot is stored somewhere (e.g. as an image) until it's no longer needed</li>
 *     <li>Subsequent containers will be "restored"/created from this snapshot</li>
 * </ol>
